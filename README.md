and learning how to win games the most distinctive AI problems were games. Games provided a convenient restricted domain that can be formalised easily.

method used for machine learning is regression there are two types of regression. linear regression and logistic regression. The basic idea is linear regression is to add up the effects of each of the features variable to produce the predictive value. predictions are obtained from linear regressions when both the weights and the input features are known. for example whenever you add, say, two kilos of carrots into your shopping basket the bill goes up 8C. when you add another kilos, the bill goes up another 8C, and if add half as much, 4C. His is the task solved by machine learning.
