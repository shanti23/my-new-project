Building AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the 
simulation of human intelligence in machines 
that are programmed to think like humans and 
mimic their actions. The term may also be 
applied to any machine that exhibits traits 
associated with a human mind such as learning 
and problem-solving. The course tries to 
introduce us to basics that enable us to
 understand what is AI and how it is creating 
impact on our lives. It explains underlying 
technologies like, for example machine 
learning, neural networks, etc. It also 
provides examples related to the topic for 
better understanding.
Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
This course speaks how Ai is being evolving around you and how this human intelligence can actually be handy and what is the future with this advance techniques humans are adapting to and what social implication we face in the present world.

The Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. AI problem solving, talks about some of the uses of AI, particularly for solving puzzles and learning how to win games the most distinctive AI problems (besides cracking Nazi codes) were games. Games provided a convenient restricted domain that could be formalized easily. closely related to games, search and planning techniques were an area where AI led to great advances in the 1960s algorithms with names such as the Minimax algorithm or Alpha-Beta Pruning, which were developed then, are still the basis for game playing AI.
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
Another method used for machine learning is regression there are 2 types of regression. Linear regression and logistic regression The basic idea in linear regression is to add up the effects of each of the feature variables to produce the predicted value.  predictions are obtained from linear regression when both the weights and the input features are known. For example, whenever you add, say, two kilos of carrots into your shopping basket, the bill goes up 8€. When you add another two kilos, the bill goes up another 8€, and if you add half as much, 1kg, the bill goes up exactly half as much, 4€. his is the task solved by machine learning.
Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
